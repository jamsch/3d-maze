			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				The goal of 3DMaze is to create a situation that encourages online communication and collaboration in a setting that presents older ideas in truly contemporary ways. These concepts are ones of anonymous
				file sharing, mark making and virtual graffiti, and regarding the medium of video gaming itself; the value and process of item collection. 
				These ideas overshadow their accessible platform; the maze. 3DMaze is meant to be fun and playable by all, but to present meaning and depth to those who look for it.

				<h2>FAQs</h2>
				<div class="question-divider">
					<p id="question">What is the Finder's Folder?</p>
					<p class="answer">
						The Finder's Folder is sort of the equivalent to the treasure at the end of the maze. Unlike other 
						aspects of the maze (which are editable by anyone) only those who find the folder while playing the game get to add 
						to it. This adds value to the accomplishment of completing the maze.

				<div class="question-divider">
					<p id="question">What kinds of files should I upload?</p>
					<p class="answer">
						Anything you would like to share! Any art, music, or writing that you made is perfect. Don't make things? 
						Share something that interests you. 
					</p>

				<div class="question-divider">
					<p id="question">Do my changes affect the maze in real time?</p>
					<p class="answer">
						Not exactly. Anything you do on the <a href="../make">make</a> or <a href="../draw">draw</a> pages won't
						show up in any mazes that have already been loaded (i.e. the people playing the game now). But any mazes that are loaded 
						between now, and when someone else edits your edits will be exactly how you saved them. As for drawings, there is no eraser,
						so yours should be there for a while.

				<div class="question-divider">
					<p id="question">What is the "all walls must be connected error" on the <a href="../make">make</a> page?</p>
					<p class="answer">
						This means that you have an "island" (a section of walls that are isolated from the rest of the walls) 
						somewhere in the maze. In order to not make the maze too difficult, every wall
						must be connected adjacent or diagonally to the rest of the walls in the maze.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="question-divider">
					<p id="question">Game lags, especially when I pick up an item? Is this normal?</p>
					<p class="answer">
						3D rendering in a browser can sometimes be a little rough, especially when your browser is
						also trying to download files. Sometimes it takes a minute or two for the game to quit feeling jerky. 
						Also try using the arrow controls instead of the mouse. If it persists try closing some applications on
						your computer.
